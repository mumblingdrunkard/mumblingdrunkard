= mumblingdrunkard ğŸ‘‹

Overtime student, taking a bachelor in EE and a bachelor in CS.

I'm interested in way too much stuff, mostly centered around programming. If you
can program it, I'm probably interested in it. I like engineering solutions to
problems that other people find difficult.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust
